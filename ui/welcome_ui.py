    ## Bridging Communication Gaps
    
    The Indian Sign Language (ISL) System is an innovative application designed to facilitate 
    communication between sign language users and non-signers. Our system offers multiple modes:
    
    ### üñêÔ∏è Sign Recognition
    - Detect and interpret sign language gestures through your webcam
    - Build sentences from recognized signs
    - Translate sign language to text and speech
    
    ### üí¨ Sign Generation
    - Convert natural language text or speech into Indian Sign Language videos
    - Support for multiple input languages including English, Tamil, and Telugu
    - Create continuous sign language sequences
    
    ### üìä Data Collection
    - Collect training data for new signs
    - Structured data collection workflow
    - Support for multiple sign categories
    
    ### üéØ Model Training
    - Train new models on collected data
    - Multiple model architectures supported
    - Real-time training progress monitoring
    
    ### üìà Comparative Study
    - Compare different model architectures
    - Performance analysis and visualization
    - Model selection and optimization

        ### Sign Recognition Mode
        1. Select the models you want to use
        2. Start detection and perform signs in front of your webcam
        3. Add detected words to build a sentence
        4. Translate and listen to your sentence
        
        ### Sign Generation Mode
        1. Enter text or use speech recognition
        2. The system will convert to ISL gloss format
        3. Watch the combined sign language video
        
        ### Data Collection Mode
        1. Select the sign category to collect data for
        2. Follow the on-screen instructions
        3. Perform signs in front of your webcam
        
        ### Training Mode
        1. Select the data to train on
        2. Choose model architecture
        3. Monitor training progress
        
        ### Comparative Study Mode
        1. Select models to compare
        2. Run the comparative analysis
        3. View results and performance metrics

        ### For Sign Recognition & Data Collection
        - Ensure good lighting conditions
        - Position yourself clearly in the camera view
        - Perform signs slowly and clearly
        - Keep a consistent distance from the camera
        
        ### For Speech Input
        - Speak clearly and at a normal pace
        - Minimize background noise
        - Use a good quality microphone
        - Start speaking shortly after clicking the button
